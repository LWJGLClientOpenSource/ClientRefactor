# ClientRefactor #
*Refactoring a LWJGL Client*

Client is **not compilable** as of now, the issue is the client class due to missing variables. This will become resolved over time.

The classes which contain the openGL and lwjgl code are fully compilable, and **may** be transplanted to fit your needs. this is done to move the whole "development" forward, rather than it being a dick-measuring contest. Whether you're a complete noob, or a pro, you're free to use parts of the code. I'm not those people that is an elitist to compensate for them lacking basic human needs, irl.

This will soon move away from the whole jag based filedata, objects, and maps. And might become it's own engine that's fully custom. Will have its own encrpytion as well to minimize amount of time required to pack and unpack and code length + confusion for noobs.
